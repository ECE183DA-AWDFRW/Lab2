# Introduction


The purpose of this lab was to create a music playing robotic "band." This was done through the use of two ESP8266 microcontrollers. One read input from a distance sensor to play a note through a speaker, while the other used an IR obstacle sensor to determine if it should hit a drum. The robots were controlled through a web interface.
